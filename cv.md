### Briefly About Myself:

I am a person focused on personal development and I aim to enter the software sector through automation. I also want to advance to a software developer position. <br>
I have theoretical knowledge in Python programming and test automation, and I am actively working to improve my skills in these areas. I have gained theoretical knowledge and practical experience in functional and non-functional testing through manual testing on uTest.com. I know the basics of Test Plans, Checklists, Test Cases, Bug Reports, and Test Result Reports.<br>
I have laid the theoretical foundations in SQL, HTML, and XPath and I am open to further development in these areas.<br> 
I have beginner-level theoretical and practical knowledge in Robot Framework, Selenium, Unittest, and Pytest. My ability to work effectively both in a team and independently, along with my quick learning skills and flexible work approach,  makes me effective in dynamic work environments.<br>
My interest in technology and passion for continuous learning guide me in my career journey. I aim to add value in the fields of software development and test automation and improve my skills in these sectors.

### Code example:

**example**
*This is the traditional way to create a loop, giving you control over the index.*

```javascript
// 1. Let's define an array of strings (city names).
const cities = ["Istanbul", "London", "Tokyo", "New York"];

// 2. We will use a for loop to iterate through the array.
//    - The loop starts with the index at 0 (i = 0).
//    - It continues as long as the index is less than the array's length.
//    - The index (i) increases by 1 after each iteration.
for (let i = 0; i < cities.length; i++) {
  
  // 3. Access the element at the current index.
  let currentCity = cities[i];
  
  // 4. Print a message to the console.
  console.log("Now visiting:", currentCity);
}

console.log("The tour is complete!");
